# Animal game - still in beta :)
When my little girl was 1.5 years, I got her some wooden toys for Christmas. One of them had you build five animals out of 
blocks. It was called a game but I didn't see how. I got to thinking that if you just added a die, it would be a game.

## Rules
There are 1-4 players (no point playing alone but I'm thinking of adding "an AI player" to a future version). 
A player rolls a die and the number determines which animal gets a block:
1. Frog
2. Duck
3. Pig
4. Cow
5. Horse
6. Free pick!

The animals are different sizes: a frog has just one block, a duck two etc. When a player finishes an animal, they get a point. 
Once all animals are ready, the game announces the winner.

## Usage
Here you can find a zip with an exe plus JAR files. Extract them all and run the exe. Not sure if works fool-proof...

# My personal projects

(the following are probably under wrong headings but I don't speak business-ese x-D )
## Vision
I want to learn programming because I wish to find my place in the world of technology, be it as a developer or something else. 
This game is my first contribution to my portfolio.

## Mission
I want to remake the game in different languages/technologies that I learn along the way.

## Strategy
After [the Java Programming I MOOC](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/), I made the very first version in Java which I developed 
further after part II of the same MOOC. Currently I'm taking [the Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/) (among others) so I may 
look into one of those technologies for this.
